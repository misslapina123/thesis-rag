Elon Musk eats humble pie over unpaid bakery bill

Elon Musk has stepped in to foot the bill for 4,000 mini pies after his firm cancelled an order at the last minute.
Giving Pies bakery in San Francisco was left $2,000 (£1,500) out of pocket when Tesla backed out just before delivery.
But when the small business took to social media to complain, Mr Musk said he would stump up the dough.
He even had Tesla place a new order - but the bakery said it was now so flooded with business from well-wishers it was too busy to take it on.
"It's incredible, I'm blown away," Voahangy Rasetarinera, the owner of the San Jose bakery, told NBC.
"I'm so grateful, it's amazing, people are amazing."

Her response came after Mr Musk took to social media to resolve the dispute.
"Just hearing about this," he said in a post on X, formerly Twitter, responding to a local news story about Tesla cancelling the order.
"Will make things good with the bakery. People should always be able to count on Tesla trying its best."
Making a crust
Ms Rasetarinera also explained why Tesla's fresh request - for 3,600 more mini pies - was one she had to turn down.
"Unfortunately, I can not do their catering event because with all the business that we got, we depleted our stock," she said.
The mayor of San Jose was even among those popping in for a pie - and he said queues for the bakery "wrapped around the block".
"It's inspiring to see our community come together to support Voahangy and her small business after a big order recently fell through," he said in a post on X.
"Stop by The Giving Pies the next time you're looking for a delicious dessert and help support an amazing local entrepreneur.
"And thanks to Elon Musk for making it right by paying for the pies after all!"
