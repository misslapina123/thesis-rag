What we know
* Israeli special forces have entered the main hospital in southern Gaza, raiding a site where thousands of Palestinians had sought shelter. The Israeli military said that the operation was based on "credible intelligence" that Hamas held captives taken in the Oct. 7 attacks at the Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis and that bodies of Israeli hostages may be at the site. Gaza's Health Ministry confirmed the site had been stormed after the Israel Defense Forces forced the evacuation of civilians.
* Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed last night to push forward with his planned invasion of Rafah, saying his army will undertake "powerful action" once civilians have been allowed to flee Gaza's southernmost city. His comments came amid mounting international concern about the offensive. A trio of key U.S. allies today warned against a "catastrophic" assault.
* Elsewhere, on a visit to the country's north, Israel's military chief said yesterday that his forces will be "ready for war" and "push back all the capabilities" the Hezbollah militant group has across the country's border with Lebanon. His comments came after IDF strikes killed at least 12 people in Lebanon after a deadly rocket attack inside Israel.
* Israel also said Hamas has not put forward any new suggestions for a hostage release and temporary cease-fire deal in discussions in the Egyptian capital, Cairo. Netanyahu dismissed the militant group's earlier demands as "delusional."
* One of the hostages, Yair Yaakov, has died in captivity, according to the Hostages and Missing Persons Families Forum. Yaakov, 59, was abducted from kibbutz Nir Oz on Oct. 7, the group said.
* More than 28,500 people have been killed in Gaza since the war began, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. More than 68,200 have been injured, and thousands more are missing and presumed dead.
* Israeli military officials said at least 232 soldiers have been killed during the ground invasion of Gaza.
